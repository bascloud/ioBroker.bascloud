# Developer manual

This section is intended for the developer.

## Scripts in `package.json`

Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `build` | Compile the TypeScript sources. |
| `watch` | Compile the TypeScript sources and watch for changes. |
| `test:ts` | Executes the tests you defined in `*.test.ts` files. |
| `test:package` | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test:integration` | Tests the adapter startup with an actual instance of ioBroker. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files and your tests. |
| `check` | Performs a type-check on your code (without compiling anything). |
| `lint` | Runs `ESLint` to check your code for formatting errors and potential bugs. |
| `translate` | Translates texts in your adapter to all required languages, see [`@iobroker/adapter-dev`](https://github.com/ioBroker/adapter-dev#manage-translations) for more details. |
| `release` | Creates a new release, see [`@alcalzone/release-script`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#usage) for more details. |

## Test the adapter manually with dev-server

Since you set up `dev-server`, you can use it to run, test and debug your adapter.

You may start `dev-server` by calling from your dev directory:

```bash
dev-server watch
```

The ioBroker.admin interface will then be available at http://localhost:8081/

Please refer to the [`dev-server` documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/dev-server#command-line) for more details.

## Test the adapter manually with an actual ioBroker instance

You can also test your adapter in an actual ioBroker instance.

1. Build your adapter:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Run the pack command:
   ```bash
   npm pack
   ```
3. Upload the resulting `iobroker.bascloud-*.tgz` file to your ioBroker instance and install it.
4. Start the adapter in the ioBroker interface.
